This was an attempt to start my own blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). One of the advantages of Jekyll, besides using plain text files with no database (which means dead fast performance while users view your blog), is that it can be hosted directly from the github pages. This way you can have your own blog without the need to have a Web Host provider.

I ended up using Wordpress for my blog, [programandconquer.com](http://programandconquer.com/?rfr=git), but it was a fun journey to learn about Jekyll and to build a blog with it. Even though I’m not currently using this Jekyll blog, it’s live [here](http://andreruivo.com/blog/).
